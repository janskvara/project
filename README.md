# The autonomous gamer

A repository for the semestral project in the course 
**Advanced Artificial Intelligence for Games** on TEK SDU Odense

The project is focused on using AI to play simple games via screen-capture technology, drawing data directly from the screen and in real time. Main focus is on the *chrome dino* game, which, albeit simple, still makes the AI training hard by implementing a lot of randomness, each run having a different, generated track.

The technologies used are **convolutional neural networks** (*pytorch* backend), specifically ResNet and SqueezeNet and Deep Reinforcement Learning (see the [dqn branch](https://github.com/janskvara/project/tree/dqn)).
